# node-digimesh

This is a node module that implements the XBee Digimesh protocol.

**NOTE:** This is still unstable, and under development. If you want to use it,
then help me build it.

## Dependencies
- node-serialport

## Description

The goal is to wrap the DigiMesh protocol with a simple interface that doesn't
require a user to worry about binary buffers.

The XBees must be in API mode (AP=1).

## API

TBD. For now, RTFS.
